      <h2>Reflection # 4: Information Architecture</h2>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">This topic is new to me since this was my first time, I have heard of it, but it is a very
      interesting topic it can helped us build a website organized in an effective and sustainable way.
      This topic I can applied it to my succeeding projects and assignments since it can help me to think
      a better and improved the design more in an organized manner. Looking at a perspective of a user,
      even us is a user of some applications, we can say that getting info on the user can help our
      application be better and for the benefit of the user. I also learned the topics value since different
      users will use on how they navigate and search for the information.
      Just like in an e-commerce website, users will find a way in example they are finding for a
      specific item that they want and they donâ€™t want to look for another item so they simply use the
      search filter to speed up their searching time for the item that they want. If the users can jump to
      their destination quickly on a website, then they could have a nice satisfaction to the product and
      website. It was an interesting topic for me since it is also included in a UX design.</p>
