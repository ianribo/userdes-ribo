        <h2>Guide Question #1: User Design</h2>
        <h3>A. What is Design?</h3>
        <p>
        <p style="color:black;">•According to the definition Oxford Languages in Google, it is aplan or drawing that is
          created to demonstrate the design
          and purpose of a work of a house, buildings, etc. (Oxford University Press, n.d.)</p>
      </header>
      <h3>B. What is User Design?</h3>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">•Developers and Designteams are using process design to build products with realistic and
        suitable user experience. This
        involves the design of the entire product creation and integration cycle including aspects of branding,
        architecture,
        usability, and feature.(Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.)</p>
      <h3>C. What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it matter?</h3>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">•In designing an application, they are both elements and it is crucial to a product or
        work together. But they have differences, UX (User Experience) is any interaction to any user that has a product
        or service and can be interacted physically while the UI (User Interface) is the look or feel and the
        presentation of a product.
        •They matter because they can make a product more appealing to the customer/user. They are both essential for
        the product’s success.</p>
      <h3>D. Who are the users? Why are they important?</h3>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">•The users are the customers that would benefit to the product. They can also have a
        feedback on what could the
        application/product that needs to improve.</p>
