      <h2>Reflection # 2: Introduction to Design Thinking Process</h2>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">Getting to know what Design Thinking Process it is a fun lesson learn. It talks about the
      process of creating a design for a problem or issues that can help/improve the improved future
      result. It can make a designer/creator to think what can be improved to their product so that the
      clients and users would have a great expectation to see on their product. To know the
      improvements of the product, they must gather feedback from their clients or users so that it could
      help them what to change on their certain product.
      There are steps on knowing the design thinking process, First one is the Empathize,
      knowing what the user’s problems and I should have an empathetic understanding of their problem
      that we are trying to solve since they would benefit for our product. To also know their needs,
      being empathetic is crucial to a human-centered design process due to the fact that it allows us to
      set aside our own assumptions and gain real insights into users or clients and their needs. Second
      one is, define – Defining what the users needs and problems and it’s time to analyze and synthesize
      it to define the core problems and the designer would identified their problem statements just like
      we did on our userdes. Third one is, Ideate – look for an alternative ways to view the problem and
      identify solutions that can solve the problems. Fourth step is, Prototyping, start creating solution
      and apply it in the product and brainstorm the generated ideas that has been made. Sketching in
      paper or what we call low fidelity is a good start on creating a prototype. Final step is the Trying
      the solution of the product or called the Testing to know what is lacking so that you can come back
      from the previous stages and make iterative solutions, alterations and refinements to the product.</p>
