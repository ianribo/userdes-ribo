      <header><strong>Queston #1. How can we improve this? You can point out details and give comments for improvements.</strong>
      <p><p style = "color:black"> There are ways on how I will solve and improve this invitation appropriately. The steps I would make on this invitation is to make the invitation more pleasant to read and if invitations are nice to see it would make the guests feel valued with invitations.

        In pointing out details on how to improve this invitation is, First, it must have a tone for the event for it to work to convey the overall of an event since this is after-dinner party. The design for me must be related to food like designation of wine, cakes, or decorative food that can be putted in an invitation. Second, the word “nibbles” must be capitalized and changed to snacks since nibbles definition is take a small bite, so that it would be formal to the reader and the time part, it must be 9:30 PM not small “pm”, and “June 30, 2012” not June 30th. Third, directions must be provided by the inviter and they can put the landmark and map on the back of the invitation so that they wouldn’t have hard time and almost places in the Philippines can be accessible by the Waze especially in the urban areas. Fourth step is Letting the inviter know that they will be attending, they must provide contact details of the inviter so that they could easily be contacted, and they will know if they will attend the party.</p>

<header><strong>Question #2. What would be the objective function?
      Tell me what the passage is all about. What is the objective?</strong>
        <p><p style="color:black">The passage is all about to know the invited selected people that they can attend the afterdinner party. Wines and foods
        are served in the after-dinner party on the day of June 30, 2012. It would be held at the house of Robert and Alexandra’s residence. The objective of the invitation is to reserve the invited people positions and so that the inviter will know the participants and they could prepare food enough for the people that are surely attend the after-dinner party. In order to know the direction the inviter must provide the location of their residence if the
        guests will asks for their exact location.</p>
