      <h2>Reflection # 3: Need Finding (Design Problem)</h2>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">I am a member of Group 3 and Ms. Caubang is our Leader. For the past few weeks, and
      for the work of our project, our class was subdivided into 7 groups. We had a smooth and proper
      distribution of tasks into us and we had a group collaboration and cooperation. The first
      presentation, we had trouble presenting of our project since there are technical difficulties that
      happened. We fix the feedback that we received from other groups and tried to fix our next
      presentation since Problem statement must be revised and Technical difficulties happened. Aldwin
      Vergara suggested that we can try to audio record our voice and put it into the PowerPoint
      presentation, and the Day of the presentation we had a smooth presenting our group ideas and
      PowerPoint.
      The ideas that we present was to be efficient in using time management using website that
      features Pomodoro technique and can help the persona’s/users to make an adjustments per task
      and have a time limit for each tasks so that the user can efficiently have a pattern on using it’s time
      for the day. Since online classes started, we collaborated to come up with this idea (even us
      students) have a hard time coping-up with managing our time.</p>
