      <h2>Reflection # 5: Visual Information Design</h2>
      <p>
      <p style="color:black;">We discussed and learned to each other about the task that we have done last week. It is
      the invitation that was given to us individually and fix the invitation that was given to us. The task
      was instructed to us on how to partially improve it since it has a disarrangement of information
      inside the letter. It needs to be improved so that the guest invited would not be hard time looking
      and reading the invitation. We as a student and I gave a tips and steps on how to improve it to
      make the letter be pleasant and readable to the guest invited.
      At first, I read the letter and make a proofread to it since the capitalization of words and
      inappropriate indentions of words inside the letter. Second, I talked about how to improve its
      design since it was indicated in the instruction that we may use an application to create our own
      version and passage of the design of the letter. The passage talks about the inviter invites the guest
      to come in their after-party if they were available at that time and inform them to give the location
      if they would come to the party. I also put a simple wine and red theme design since it was more
      appropriate to the invitation letter and it suits in it.
      At the meeting, we had discussed each and some of the individual works of our answers
      on our invitation letter and how we come up on each design and its improvements to it. It must
      have an appropriate designs and font so that it would not be hard to read the letter and it is more
      pleasant to the eyes of the reader. This would also apply to our websites to utilize the minimalistic
      of the design so that the user would not hard time controlling/using the application.</p>
