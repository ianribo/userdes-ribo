        <h2>Reflection # 6: Color Theory and Typography</h2>
        <p>
        <p style="color:black;">The week 10 of the meeting is that day Miss Jen was absent due to internet issues and
          she gave us a task to watch a
          YouTube clip video that is related to User design and we also played a game that is also related to design.
          The first
          thing I do is watched the video that was given to us and it shows that the bad fonts and typography that is
          used in a
          show and it really had a hard time to read for the speaker. The professionals are suggesting that it has a
          proper
          typography to be read clearly by the speaker. Just like what happened on Miss Universe Pageant 2015. It also
          applies
          this situation for us like programmers and UI/UX designers, since web/mobile applications has an informative
          text/designs that needs to be red clearly by the users and has a pleasing design.
          The second video we have watched is the font cooper black, it talks about the history of the fonts “Cooper
          Black” fonts
          and it can be seen everywhere, and it was explained how it started since the world war 1 and it is also used
          font until
          today. The next tasks are a game learning tasks “Kerntype” it teaches us the spaces of the fonts between/next
          letters it
          would give us a score if we put the wire in an appropriate way. The next game is the Brand seen it tests our
          knowledge
          on how well I know these brands and somehow, I get a high score in this game. The 3rd game is the Triangle a
          better web
          type game that can help me implement the theory developed by Matej Latin. The last game is the TypeWar, I had
          a hard
          time getting a streak since I am not familiar of some fonts given in the game, but it teaches me know what
          some of the
          fonts are that is being asked in the given, some of it are well guessed and some of it is I know what type of
          font it
          is.
